## Overview

Parallax is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect in a travel-themed user interface.

- Search functionality with a magnifying glass icon.
- Travel-themed UI elements for inspiration.

## iTravel Demo App
This package also includes a demo app called "iTravel" that showcases how to integrate and use the Parallax SwiftUI package in a real-world travel-themed application. You can explore the iTravel app to see the package in action and learn how to implement it in your projects.
